                Hinduism has its roots in the Indus Valley Civilization that
                developed in what is now Pakistan and northwestern India around
                2600 BCE to 1900 BCE. Hindu communities have been present in
                Sindh for thousands of years, with the region being ruled by
                Hindu kingdoms and empires such as the Sindhudesh Kingdom and
                the Rajput-era Kingdom of Alor. During this time, Hinduism
                continued to evolve and diversify, with the development of new
                philosophical schools of thought and the composition of sacred
                texts such as the Vedas and the Upanishads.

                During the 7th century, Arab armies invaded and conquered Sindh,
                bringing Islam to the region. During the Mughal period
                (1526-1857), Hindus faced religious persecution and
                discrimination, but continued to maintain a significant presence
                in Sindh. During this time, Hinduism also saw the development of
                Bhakti movements, which emphasized devotion and personal
                connection to a deity as a means of spiritual liberation.

                In 1843, the British East India Company took control of Sindh,
                leading to the establishment of British colonial rule in the
                region. During this period, Hindu communities in Sindh faced
                further discrimination and marginalization, but were able to
                maintain their religious and cultural traditions through the
                establishment of religious institutions and the preservation of
                sacred texts. The Hindu reform movements of the 19th and early
                20th centuries, such as the Brahmo Samaj and the Arya Samaj,
                also gained traction in Sindh and sought to modernize and
                rejuvenate Hinduism.

                In 1947, with the partition of India, Hindu communities in Sindh
                were forced to flee to India as refugees due to the violence and
                chaos that followed independence. Today, there is a small Hindu
                community in Sindh, but their numbers and influence have
                diminished significantly since the partition. Nevertheless,
                Hindu religious and cultural traditions continue to play an
                important role in the region's history and heritage, and Hindu
                pilgrims still visit sites such as the Shiva temple in Hala, the
                Jain temples in Hyderabad, and the Sufi shrines of Lal Shahbaz
                Qalandar and Sachal Sarmast.

        <p>
          The Sindhi script is one of rich history and cultural significance.
          Initially, the script was written in the Khudabadi script, a script
          derived from the Brahmi script used in ancient India. However, after
          the Arab conquest of Sindh, the script was gradually replaced by the
          Arabic script. As a result, many Sindhi Hindus today do not know how
          to write in the original Sindhi script, and it is primarily only
          spoken among them. The loss of this script is a significant loss to
          the Sindhi culture and heritage. Despite the efforts to revive the
          script, it remains an endangered yet important symbol of Sindhi
          identity. Many organizations and individuals continue to work to
          preserve and promote the use of Sindhi script, both in Sindh and
          abroad.

          In an effort to reconnect with my heritage, I collated the history of
          Sindhi Hindus to ensure that our history is never forgotten, even if
          our homeland was lost.
